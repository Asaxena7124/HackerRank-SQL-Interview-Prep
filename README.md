# 🧠 HackerRank SQL Interview Prep

This repository documents my **SQL interview preparation journey using HackerRank**, organized **question-wise** with a strong focus on **concept clarity and interview readiness**.

Rather than only solving problems, this repo explains **why each SQL clause is used**, common **interview questions around those clauses**, and **how to answer them clearly**.
